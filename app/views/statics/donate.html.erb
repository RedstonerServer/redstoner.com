<h1>Donate</h1>

<p>Running a server is really stressful and requires a lot of work.<br>
  Donating keeps us motivated to do all the work, pay eventual bills, etc.</p>
<p>Donations are made via <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>. We will eventually add more payment methods if we get many requests. (Use the forums)</p>
<p>If you cannot, or do not want to donate, that's totally fine!<br>
  Just thank us for running the server, it barely happens but really makes us happy :)</p>
<p>While we do appreciate every amount of donation, we have decided to create two special ranks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Donator ($5 or more)
  <li>Donator+ ($20 or more)
</ul>

<p>We also have <%= link_to "list of users who donated", users_path(badge: "donor") %> already!</p>

<h3>Perks for you</h3>
<p>For <i>Donator</i> and <i>Donator+</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>The warm feeling of donating for a good thing, plus a huge "<b>thank you</b>"!
  <li>You can have a nickname. See <%= link_to "our nickname guidelines", info_path("12-nickname-guidelines") %>
  <li>A "$" next to your name <i>(Including website)</i>
  <li><i>Donator+</i> has access to the in-game command <code>/lol id</code></li>
</ul>
